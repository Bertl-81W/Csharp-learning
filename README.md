# C# Learning 

Initial .NET console app for C# practice
- Project: HelloCSharp
- Goal: Learn C# basics, OOP, build

After spending the last couple of years teaching myself frontend development, I started noticing that what I enjoyed the most wasn’t necessarily building UI layouts — but solving problems, researching, debugging, and figuring out why something wasn’t working. I’m now learning C# and moving toward software testing because it feels like a natural direction for me.

With all the changes happening in tech and the rise of AI, I realized that having testing skills and understanding how software behaves underneath the surface lets me work hands-on with real code, understand what breaks and why, and see how different parts of a system fit together. It also gives me the chance to learn from other people’s code while improving my own.

I am embarking on this journey with a background in frontend and many years of experience solving problems in the real world, and I want to build something long-term. This project is just the start of me building a foundation in C#, testing, and the kind of technical thinking that makes software solid and reliable.
